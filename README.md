# 🧠 AI-feedback-assistant for academic writing
An NLP-based intelligent assistant that provides automated feedback on academic writing (essays, research reports, assignments).
The system evaluates text for clarity, coherence, and potential plagiarism, helping students and researchers improve their writing quality.

# 🚀 Features
✅ Clarity Evaluation – Zero-shot classification using pre-trained BERT/RoBERTa models

✅ Coherence Scoring – Measures semantic flow between paragraphs using SBERT

✅ Plagiarism Detection – Compares input with reference corpus using cosine similarity

✅ Automated Feedback Generation – Converts results into human-readable feedback

✅ Streamlit Web App – User-friendly interface for real-time feedback
